        <p>
            <a href="https://forbeslibrary.org">Forbes Library</a> is Northampton, Massachusettsâ€™ main public library,
            located centrally in downtown. Apart from providing books and other media to the public, it also provides
            other community resources and services like
            hosting events. <strong>I chose this site to redesign because, especially in an increasingly virtual world, public
            libraries should provide simple, clean, and straightforward interfaces for people to interact with online.</strong> I
            have identified several ways in which the existing Forbes site fails to do this, which I will discuss below.
